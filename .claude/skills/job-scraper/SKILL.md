# Job Scraper

---

## How It Works

This skill searches job portals using the **installed portal-search CLIs** in
`.agents/skills/` (plus WebSearch as a fallback), using queries from your profile.
It deduplicates against previously seen jobs and the application tracker, and
presents new matches with a quick fit assessment.

## Invocation

The user triggers this skill by saying things like:
- "Find new jobs"
- "Scrape for jobs"
- "Any new positions?"
- "/scrape"

Optional arguments:
- A focus area, e.g. "/scrape data science" or "/scrape geophysics"
- "broad" to run all search categories, e.g. "/scrape broad"
- "health" to run the portal health check only (Step 4.75), without searching, deduplicating, or presenting jobs - e.g. "/scrape health", or "/scrape health jobnet" to probe one portal even if disabled

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Load State

1. Read `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json` (create if missing - start with `{"seen": {}}`)
2. Read `job_search_tracker.csv` to extract already-applied companies+roles
3. Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy

### Step 0.5: Gmail Application Confirmation Check

Before searching for new jobs, query Gmail to find companies you've already applied to that may not appear in `job_search_tracker.csv`. This catches LinkedIn Easy Apply submissions, ATS-direct applications, and any role applied to but not yet logged.

**Run two Gmail searches using `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__search_threads` (run in parallel):**

1. Confirmation emails (inbound):
   ```
   ("thanks for applying" OR "thank you for applying" OR "application received" OR "we received your application") newer_than:60d
   ```
2. Sent application emails (outbound):
   ```
   in:sent ("applied" OR "application") newer_than:60d
   ```

Cap both at 50 results. For each thread returned, extract:
- **Company name** from the subject line or snippet (e.g. `"Ekam, thanks for applying to Vena!"` → `vena`)
- **Role** if discernible from the subject or snippet

Build a **`gmail_applied`** set: a list of `{company: string (lowercase), role_hint: string}` pairs.

**During Step 2 dedup**, also skip any job result whose company name loosely matches an entry in `gmail_applied` (case-insensitive substring match). When a Gmail match causes a skip, record it as:
```
skipped (applied per Gmail): Company — Role
```
Surface these skips in the Step 5 summary so the user can verify. Also add the matched job to `job_search_tracker.csv` with `status=applied` and note `source=gmail-inferred` in the notes column, so the tracker stays in sync.

**Bounds:** At most 2 Gmail search calls, 50 results each. If Gmail is unavailable or returns an auth error, log `gmail check: unavailable` in the Step 5 summary and continue — do not abort the scrape.

### Step 0.75: Stale Application Check

Scan the tracker loaded in Step 0. Before running any searches, flag applications that may need a follow-up message.

**Flag as follow-up due:** any row where `status` is `applied` and more than **10 business days** have elapsed since `date_applied` (exclude weekends; count Mon–Fri only).

For each flagged application, draft a short follow-up email:
- **Subject:** `Following up — [Role] at [Company]`
- **Body:** 3 sentences max. Restate specific interest in the role, name one thing about the company or role that stood out, ask politely about timeline or next steps. No desperation. No demands.

Cap at **3 drafts per run** (oldest applications first). If more than 3 are stale, list all in the table but only draft for the 3 oldest.

Present stale applications **before the Step 5 job table** (after the Gmail skip summary) under this heading:

```
### Follow-up Due (N applications)
| Company | Role | Applied | Business Days Waiting |
|---------|------|---------|----------------------|
| ...     | ...  | ...     | ...                  |

**Draft — [Company]:**
Subject: Following up — [Role] at [Company]
---
[3-sentence email body]
---
```

Skip this step entirely if no applications meet the 10-business-day threshold.

### Step 1: Search

Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy. By default, run the top 3 priority query categories. If the user said "broad", run all categories. If the user specified a focus area (e.g. "data science"), prioritize queries from that category.

**Use the installed CLI tools as the primary search mechanism.** Fall back to `WebSearch` only for portals that do not have a CLI skill, or if `bun` is unavailable on the system.

#### 1a. Check bun availability

```bash
bun --version
```

If this fails (bun not installed), skip to **1c (WebSearch fallback)** for all portals and note the fallback in the Step 5 output.

#### 1b. Run CLI tools (primary — run these in parallel where possible)

Discover all installed portal CLI skills by reading every `SKILL.md` found under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each file documents that portal's exact CLI flags and usage examples. **Use each portal's own documented interface — do not guess flags.** This approach automatically includes any new portals added via `/add-portal` without requiring changes to this file.

**Honor the `enabled` toggle.** A portal is enabled unless its `SKILL.md` frontmatter sets `enabled: false` (a missing key means enabled — the default). Skip each disabled portal and record it for the Step 5 summary. A fork can thus keep a portal installed but sit out a run without deleting its directory.

For each **enabled** portal skill:

1. Read its `SKILL.md` to find the correct `bun run …` invocation and supported flags.
2. Translate the query terms from `search-queries.md` into that portal's flag format (e.g. `--key`, `--search-string`, `--query`, filter codes — whatever the portal's SKILL.md specifies).
3. Scope to the last 14 days using the portal's supported recency flag (`--jobage`, `--since <YYYY-MM-DD>`, `--order PublicationDate`, etc. — as documented per portal).
4. Cap results to ~20 per call using the portal's limit flag.
5. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.

Run all portal CLI calls in parallel where possible using the Agent tool. Collect all `results` arrays into a single pool for Step 2, keeping each result tagged with its source portal skill (for Step 2 `detail` lookups).

If a CLI tool exits with a non-zero code, log the error message and continue — do not abort the whole search.

#### 1c. WebSearch fallback

Use `WebSearch` for:
- Portals listed in `search-queries.md` that do **not** have a corresponding directory under `.agents/skills/`
- Any portal whose CLI fails at runtime
- When bun is unavailable (Step 1a failed)

Use the site-specific query strings from `search-queries.md` directly as WebSearch queries for these portals.

### Step 2: Fetch & Parse

For each promising result from Step 1:

**From CLI results:** Search output already includes title, company, location, date,
and URL. For jobs worth a deeper look, fetch full detail with that portal's `detail`
command (see its SKILL.md — do not guess flags) to extract **key requirements**,
**application deadline**, and a brief description snippet.

**From WebSearch results:** Use `WebFetch` on the posting URL and extract the same
fields manually.

For every candidate:
- Skip if the **exact URL** already exists in `seen_jobs.json` (URL is the only dedup key — a re-post with a new URL is a new opportunity and must be shown even if the company+title match a previous entry)
- Skip if the company+role already appears in `job_search_tracker.csv` (you have already applied)
- Skip if the company loosely matches an entry in the `gmail_applied` set built in Step 0.5 (applied per Gmail — not yet logged in tracker)
- Skip if the company name is absent or the posting describes "our client" without naming the end employer — flag as "unnamed client posting" so the user can decide whether to pursue it
- Skip if the apply URL redirects to a third-party generic job board with no named company ATS (e.g. generic hanzilla/ziprecruiter landing pages where the company cannot be verified) — note the skip reason
- Skip if the same company+title appeared in `seen_jobs.json` within the last 7 days under a different URL — this is a re-post, not a new opportunity; consolidate and note "re-post" rather than showing as new

### Step 2.5: Mass-Posting Detection (within this run)

A distribution pattern worth flagging to the user as a caution signal, not as an accusation against the employer - it describes how a listing is being distributed, not a verdict on whether the company is legitimate. It alone proves nothing is wrong (companies do legitimately hire the same role across several cities); flag it so the user can factor it in when deciding whether to invest time, don't downgrade fit or silently exclude the result because of it.

If two or more results in this run's pool (from the same company, or sharing the same req/job ID visible in the URL or title) have substantially the same description and differ only in city/location/title, don't present them as separate rows. Consolidate into a single row and note the spread, e.g. "posted identically across 6 cities (BR, MX, GT)".

### Step 3: Quick Fit Assessment

For each new job, do a rapid fit check (NOT the full evaluation from `04-job-evaluation.md` - just a quick signal):

- **High match**: Role directly involves your core skills
- **Medium match**: Role is adjacent to your experience
- **Low match**: Role requires significant skills you lack

### Step 4: Deduplicate & Store

1. Add ALL fetched jobs (new and skipped) to `seen_jobs.json` with structure:
```json
{
  "seen": {
    "<url_or_company_title_key>": {
      "title": "...",
      "company": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "first_seen": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "fit": "high/medium/low",
      "status": "new/skipped/evaluated/ranked/expired",
      "portal": "<source portal skill, e.g. jobindex-search>"
    }
  }
}
```

The `portal` field records which CLI skill produced the job (results are already tagged per portal in Step 1b - persist that tag here). Entries written before this field existed lack it; the health check (Step 4.75) attributes those by matching the URL's domain against each portal's base URL, so do not backfill.

`/rank` extends this schema additively: ranked entries also carry `rank_score` (0–100 overall score), `rank_verdict` (fit band, e.g. "strong fit"), and `rank_date` (ISO date of ranking). The `status` field is set to `"ranked"`. Do not drop any of these fields when re-writing entries.

2. Only present jobs NOT already in the seen list or tracker.

### Step 4.5: Generate Referral Contact Links (High & Medium Fit Only)

For every job from this run with `fit` of **high** or **medium** (skip low-fit jobs),
build two LinkedIn people-search URLs so the user can find a recruiter or team member to
reach out to for a referral or a warm intro. This is deliberately a link-generation step,
not an automated lookup: no scraping, no third-party API, zero runtime dependencies or
credentials required.

**A. Recruiters / Talent Acquisition (the referral path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> recruiter">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```

**B. Role/team peers (informational-outreach / warm-intro path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> <role keyword>">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```
Use a short keyword drawn from the posting's title for `<role keyword>` - e.g. a posting
titled "AI Program Manager" becomes `"<Company Name> AI Program Manager"`.

Both links are for the user to open and browse themselves - never fetch or scrape the
LinkedIn people-search result pages programmatically. Never fabricate contacts or claim a
specific person was found; these are search links, not results.

### Step 4.75: Portal Health Check

Scraper-based portal CLIs rot silently: when a portal changes its markup, the parser usually exits 0 with zero results or with null/garbled fields, and the Step 1c fallback never fires because it only triggers on hard failure. This step catches that from evidence the run already holds.

**Free pass (no extra requests).** For each enabled portal that ran in Step 1b:

- **Degraded scan:** inspect the results it returned this run. Flags: `company` null or empty on every result, empty titles, undecoded entities (`&amp;`) or HTML fragments in titles, URLs that do not point at the portal. Any of these means the parser is half-working and `/scrape` is silently collecting junk.
- **Yield history:** if the portal returned zero results across all of this run's queries, check whether `seen_jobs.json` holds prior entries from it (via the `portal` field, or by matching URL domains for entries predating the field). A portal that produced jobs on earlier runs and produces nothing now is suspect - the same queries worked before.

**Escalation (bounded, on suspicion only).** A suspect portal gets **one** sentinel probe: run its documented `search` with the example query from its own SKILL.md (that query provably worked when the skill was registered), the portal's limit flag capped at 3, `--format json`. If that returns nothing, retry **once** with a single common word. Only then is the verdict **broken**. A 429 or block page is **never** evidence of breakage - record the portal as **inconclusive (rate-limited)**, back off, and do not retry.

**Verdicts.** Healthy portals get silence - no table, no line. Anything else surfaces in the Step 5 summary as a health line.

**Probe-only mode (`/scrape health`).** Skip Steps 1-4 and this step's free pass (there is no fresh run to scan); instead probe every installed portal directly - enabled ones by default, a disabled one only when named explicitly (e.g. `/scrape health jobnet`). Each portal gets the sentinel probe above, the degraded criteria applied to whatever it returns, and - since the user explicitly asked for diagnosis - one `detail` fetch on the first result of each healthy portal (description must be readable decoded text; a failure downgrades to degraded). Report all statuses in this mode, including healthy. Volume stays bounded: one search, at most one retry, at most one detail per portal.

### Step 5: Present Results

Present new jobs in a table sorted by fit (high first). When Step 1b skipped
portals (`enabled: false`), report them with the `skipped (disabled):` line below
so opting one out stays visible rather than silent; omit the line when nothing
was skipped. When Step 4.75 found a portal degraded, broken, or inconclusive,
add one `health:` line per suspect portal (healthy portals get no line); after
the report, offer to set that portal's `enabled: false` so `/scrape` stops
running it (and covers it via the Step 1c fallback) until it is fixed - only
edit the toggle with the user's confirmation, and never edit anything else in
the skill.

```
## New Job Matches - YYYY-MM-DD

Found X new positions (Y high, Z medium, W low match).

skipped (disabled): <portal-name>, <portal-name>

health: <portal-name> - degraded (company null on all 12 results); parsing anchors in .agents/skills/<portal-name>/url-reference.md
health: <portal-name> - broken (0 results for the SKILL.md test query and a broader retry); parsing anchors in .agents/skills/<portal-name>/url-reference.md

| # | Fit | Title | Company | Location | Deadline | URL |
|---|-----|-------|---------|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | High | ... | ... | ... | ... | [Link](...) |

If Step 2.5 flagged a mass-posting pattern, note it in the Title cell (e.g. "Frontend Developer (posted in 6 cities)") rather than burying it - it's a signal the user should see at a glance, not just in the detail highlights below.

### High-Match Highlights
For each high-match job, add 2-3 bullet points:
- Why it matches your profile
- Key requirements to check
- Any red flags (including mass-posting signals from Step 2.5)

### Contacts
For each high/medium-fit job from Step 4.5, add a short contacts block with the two
LinkedIn search links:
- Recruiters/TA search link, for the referral path
- Role/team-peer search link, for the warm-intro / informational-outreach path
```

After presenting, ask:
> "Want me to evaluate any of these in detail? Just give me the number(s)."

If the user picks a number, invoke the **job-application-assistant** skill workflow (fit evaluation first, then CV + cover letter if approved).

If the run found many new jobs (roughly 8+), also suggest `/rank` - it batch-scores all new postings against the full fit framework and returns a ranked shortlist, which beats eyeballing a long table. (`/rank` sets the `ranked` and `expired` status values in `seen_jobs.json`; treat both as already-seen for dedup purposes.)

### Step 6: Update Tracker (Optional)

If the user decides to apply to any job, add a row to `job_search_tracker.csv`.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Never fabricate job postings.** Only present jobs from actual CLI search/detail output or WebSearch/WebFetch results.
2. **Respect deduplication.** Always check seen_jobs.json, job_search_tracker.csv, AND the Gmail `gmail_applied` set (Step 0.5) before presenting. Never surface a job the user has already applied to.
3. **Focus on configured geographic area.** The configured area is defined in `search-queries.md`'s Location Filter — for this candidate it covers all of Canada. Ottawa/remote are preferred, but any Canadian city is acceptable for relocation. Exclude US-only roles and roles outside Canada. Never skip a job solely because it requires relocation within Canada.
4. **Only open positions.** Skip postings with expired deadlines or those marked as closed.
5. **Be efficient with detail fetches.** Don't run `detail` or WebFetch on every search hit — pre-filter by title/snippet, then fetch only promising matches.
6. **Parallel searches.** Run portal CLI searches in parallel; use WebSearch only for gaps the CLIs don't cover.
7. **No automated people lookups.** Referral contacts (Step 4.5) are LinkedIn search links only - never fetch or scrape LinkedIn people-search result pages programmatically.
8. **Health checks are bounded and honest.** Step 4.75 spends at most one probe, one retry, and (in `health` mode) one detail fetch per portal - a diagnosis, not a crawl. A rate-limit is never evidence of breakage. Health verdicts come only from observed CLI output; a portal that could not be tested is reported as inconclusive, never guessed. The `enabled` toggle is the only thing the health check may edit, and only with confirmation.
9. **Flag distribution patterns, never accuse.** The mass-posting signal (Step 2.5) describes how a listing is being distributed, not a claim that the employer is a scam. Never name a company as fraudulent or untrustworthy - present the observation and let the user decide.
